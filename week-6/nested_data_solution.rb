What are some general rules you can apply to nested arrays?

Treat nested arrays similar to regular arrays as long as their positioning has been considered.

What are some ways you can iterate over nested arrays?

We used a .each loop with an if else checking if the object was an array or not. I think there was probably more efficient way to do this that I have to research a little more into so that I can make this a little more dynamic, but it worked for this challenge.

Did you find any good new methods to implement or did you re-use one you were already familiar with? What was it and why did you decide that was a good option?

We learned about .kind_of to test what value the object was.
