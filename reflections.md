# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
The time management idea that interested me the most was the idea of starting small to create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and building from there. This strategy works well with Time boxing because you can break up the project and start with a MVP to work on. Time boxing is the practice of agreeing to a static timeframe that is allotted for the project instead of allowing the time to continue until the goal is reached. I think time boxing will be useful during Phase 0 because it is said to help curb perfectionist tendencies by not overcommitting to a specific task, plus time pressure can also boost creativity and focus. It is the strategy that I have been using to manage my time because it helps me separate my family and my work time. It works very well for me because I am a little bit of a procrastinator and with an endless amount of time I tend to drift my focus on less work related tasks. I plan to continue to allocate my time by breaking up the project and completing the portion within a time box.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
A shell is a user interface for accessing an operating systems services. In this example to shell we reviewed was the command line interface (CLI)

Bash is a shell that is default on OS X. It is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where users can type commands that cause actions. Bash is also capable of reading scripts, which are basically commands from within a file. Fun fact, it is an acronym for Bourne Again SHell, which was a major shell during the late 80s.
I was able to complete the commands that i reviewed during this lesson. Some of the most important commands and arguments to know if you are using the CLI would be how to properly navigate (cd, ls, ~, ../, etc.) and commands that help you remove and add things to the directories you would be in (mkdir, rm, rmdir. etc.) I would also say that it is important to know the power of certain commands, like sudo commands and the flags that can be detrimental if you aren’t familiar with what you are doing (example: rm -rf).
pwd - Print working directory
ls - list directory
mv - move a file or directory
cd - change directory
../ - parent directory
touch - make an empty file
mkdir - make a directory
less - page through a file
rmdir - remove directory
rm - remove file
help - help find command in Windows

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
Forking a repository is like getting a personal copy of the project that you are forking. It is much more efficient to fork an existing project than creating a new one from scratch. Forking can be used to build a project off of, or to help improve someone else’s by forking then submitting a pull request for them to review the updated code. If I was explaining how to create a new repository, and how to fork and clone a repo I would explain it as basic as I could.

Login to Github
Create a new repository by clicking the “+” and selecting new repository
Name the repository and decide whether you want it to be public or private (private cost money and makes your code unavailable to the public unless you add them)
To clone your repository to your computer, get your https clone URL located on the right middle of the repository.
Type pwd to make sure you are not in another GitHub local repository and are in the appropriate directory.
Clone by opening the CLI and typing "git clone [URL that you copied from GitHub]”
type ls to see that your new clone is on your local machine and cd to be able to change within that directory.
