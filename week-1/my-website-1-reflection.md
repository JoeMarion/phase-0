Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

*Click on the "+" on the top right of GitHub
*Select "New Repository"
*Name it and set it to public with the MIT License
*Once this is set up you will have a repository set up on GitHub, but the files store within this repository are not on your local machine (i.e. your computer)
*In order to copy these files, you need to "clone" the repository onto your computer
*Open up the terminal and navigate to the directory you wish to store the copied repo. (you can navigate by typing in the "cd" command and then the directory you wish to go to i.e. [cd ~/DBC-Stuff/phase-0/week-1])
*You can double check if you are within the appropriate directory by printing your current directory ("pwd")
*At this point, you need to copy the Clone URL from GitHub. Open up Github and then navigate to your repository. Once opened, you will see the link located on the right panel near the middle of the page.
*Go back into the terminal and type "git clone url-you-just-copied"
*Ta-da you now how the repo on your computer

Describe what open source means.

Open source allows the original source code to be free available to be redistributed and modified.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I feel that open source is situationally dependant. It doesn't make me nervous because when used properly it can help excel the developmental community and allows you to review how others interpretted your code so improve your own skill or even the product. Even though it is open source there are several different licenses that can be used to help regulate how you want the code used and certain licenses requires that the original code be linked to so others are aware that this code can be obtained free. I do not feel like every project should be open source due to certain competive environments, but like I said situationally dependant.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

It is important to use licenses because it can help regulate how you wish the software to be used. Software licenses can restrict how many copies of the software are distributed or what organizations can use them, or just link your open source work to any modified versions.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Not neccessarily "aha" moments, but I have a better understanding of the purpose of specific licenses (I was curious what the MIT license was when we first created a repo with it). Smashing Magazines article (http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/a-short-guide-to-open-source-and-similar-licenses/) explained the differences and really helped me understand what the difference was between licenses even between ones that were all considered open source.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I googled a couple definitions, but other than that I used the resources that DBC provided, smashing magazines article in particular.
